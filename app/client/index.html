            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>We are a group of programmers who have developed an app that accepts all major credit cards to create transactions between customer and store, store and bank and customer and bank.</p>

            <h2>What Makes Us Unique</h2>
            <p>Security is our number one priority, so in order to strive towards this, our app has a number of different functions you can use. For one, instead of just tracking transactions, using Google Maps, we have developed an interactive map that can track the exact location of your transactions. In addition to this, if a transaction takes place outside the “normal” zone you regularly make transactions from, an email notification will be sent an in order to proceed with your transaction, you must verify and approve the message. This process ensures that you and only you have access to your belongings.</p>

            <h2>Future Development</h2>
            <p>We are in the process of incorporating Google maps with ATM location.This will be an extension to our transaction location interactive map. We are also creating a way for you to “order money”. In this process, you can make a transaction using a personal device, and pre-order the money to a specific ATM at a specific frame. An email and text would be sent to verify the transaction, and when approved, the transaction can be completed. If you happen to miss the time frame, then the money will not be processed and you will have to order the money again.</p>
            <p>We are also in the process of creating an electronic card. This card is infused with nanotechnology and can identify the user based on fingerprint recognition. This functionality activates when a transaction takes place. If the card recognizes that you are not the owner, it will notify the owner of the card, the card company, and the bank, and will cause the bank account to automatically freeze.</p>
